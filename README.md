# G-Code Flow and Temperature Controller
### *A free and open-source post-processing script for OrcaSlicer to simplify 3D printing.*  
  
This script dynamically adjusts nozzle temperature and print speed (flow rate) to significantly improve print quality and reduce print time, all while simplifying slicer settings. By optimizing these parameters, it makes 3D printing more accessible, less complex and faster.  

**How Does It Work?**  
Filament gradually absorbs heat as it travels through the hotend, requiring extrusion at an optimal final temperature. This script calculates the average flow rate every second and dynamically adjusts the nozzle temperature accordingly. It also modifies print speed in the G-code to match the ideal flow rate, considering layer height and line width.  

**Why This Script?**  
Inspired by my personal approach and developed with basic Delphi programming skills, this is a proof of concept demonstrating the potential of integrating such features into slicer software. Doing so could unlock even greater efficiency and advanced capabilities for 3D printing.  

**What’s Next?**  
My next goal is to create a software solution that automates hotend and filament temperature calibration with a simple add-on for any 3D printer.  
I now rely on this script for all my prints, even with my old Klipper-based printer and low-cost filament. I keep 90% of my slicer settings unchanged, proving this method’s reliability and flexibility, and exploring its limits for advanced features.  
Hoping that people will start experimenting and developing this new concept.  
I believe this approach or something similar could shape the future of 3D printing and make it truly accessible to everyone.  
  
Your feedback and ideas are welcome. Let’s innovate and push the boundaries of 3D printing together:  
*"Alone we go faster; together we go further."*

# Instructions and Prerequisites  
1. The script can be used as a standard program by running the `SB53-Systems.exe` file and manually opening a G-Code file, or by integrating it into the slicer as a post-processing script.  
    ```
    D:\SB53_G-Code_Flow_Temperature_Controller_V1.1\SB53-Systems.exe;
    ```  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722d57b1-6568-4317-ba3f-5873c66e221c)  
  
2. Included a [Custom](https://github.com/sb53systems/klipper_estimator) version of [Klipper_Estimator V 3.7.3](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/klipper_estimator). An accurate tool that uses `Klipper Look-Ahead kinematics` to estimate the time and average flow rate for each move in the G-Code. (+/- 1s total time for Klipper Firmware). The mechanism is very close to other Firmwares (+/- 5% if used correctly).  
   Note that the file `\Klipper_estimator.exe` (already included) is required and must be in the same Folder with this Script.  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30449359-fabd-4b3d-9593-523db606c0c1)  
  
3. Editing the `First Layer Temperature` is important, the script can :
    - Edit the specified `"Start Print"` Macro (Klipper).  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b1e09e-0750-43f6-995f-8671da5838e0)  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3c814af-4522-4177-907c-7aab631505f7)
      
    - Edit the `"M109 S"` G-Code command, provided that:
      - It is preceded by the comment "; Temp_To_Edit"  
      ```
       ; Temp_To_Edit
      ```  
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a51b55dc-831b-48e2-88e8-18b2c99c3222)  
    
      - And add the comment "; PRINT_END" at the start of the `Machine End G-Code`, this will allow the script to avoid the print end Moves.  
      ```
       ; PRINT_END
      ```  
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05d7ba2e-c3fc-43bc-971b-691dd6e5ff86)  
  
4. The `Initial Temperature` estimated by the Script depends on the speed of the first moves of the G-Code, you can adjust it by fixing the speed of the `Purge Line` or the speed of the `First layer Perimeters`.  
  
5. To have a best `Speed/Quality Optemization`, the Slicer Profil must be set for Max Moves and Max Volumetric Speed. The Nozzle temperature is not important because it will be reset in the script, and the speed will be reduced (not increased) to the Recommended Flow.   
    Example below with my max 200mm/s Printer speed : (Same profil for `PLA, PETG and ABS`)  
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0a30aed-046a-48ad-b819-93def3b28de5)  
  
    The speed of `Overhangs` and small `Internal/External Bridges` should be set to the maximum speed, this will ensure that the filament is extruded at the recommended flow rate and that it is not too hot and falls off, or too cold and shrinks, also avoiding sudden flow changes and unnecessary temperature drops caused by the average flow calculated by the script.  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/050be022-7cef-47ff-b1aa-15f8b5134dce)  
    [See my overhangs test examples.](https://github.com/sb53systems/G-Code-Flow-Temperature-Controller/blob/main/Overhangs_Test.md)  
  
    For larger bridges, I use `Thick Bridges` in Orca Slicer and a single 5015 radial fan for part cooling, there is not much deference between a 60mm bridge at 30mm/s and another at 100mm/s, and since I don't print a lot of wide bridges, I prefer to keep an automatic speed.  
    [See my Bridge test examples.](https://github.com/sb53systems/G-Code-Flow-Temperature-Controller/blob/main/Bridges_Test.md)  
  
    You can use a modifier (or more) in the slicer that changes the speed of a few lower layers to the bridge, the temperature and speed should gradually decrease to the desired bridge speed. Example bellow for 50mm/s External Bridge speed. (This approach can only be optimized when it is integrated into the Slicer)

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cee9879-389b-4117-9048-b96c76e51891)  
  
6. You have to set your filament settings:
    - The maximum recommended volumetric speed at the maximum temperature that your Hotend or Filament can handle.
    - The Fan Cooling perdiode and the Min print speed, according to the Filament and your cooling configuration.
  
    You can reduce the speed of the `Cooling Fan` (Except for Bridges and Ovehangs), the `Min Print Speed`, and the `Min Layer Time`.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07c5e7c-b137-4af3-86b6-efeaecdc06cc)  
  
### Note that :  
  - The script is specifically programmed to reduce speeds only when they exceed the recommended flow rate, while lower speeds will remain as set in the G-Code (Slicer speed).
  - The script does not display the temperature curve in the generated G-Code Chart if Arcs moves are used. This is due to the integration and interpretation of the Klipper_Estimator output.
  - PA can be adjusted based on temperature only for Klipper firmware. For other firmwares you need to uncheck the Adjust PA option.  
  - Changing PA while printing can cause bubbles in the walls. The script is programmed to adjust PA only in sparse infill, internal solid infill, support, and internal bridges.  
  ![351913375-991fe2b8-3935-46ff-816e-5b0aee981b4d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/602b96a8-2666-44bd-b70f-aa5c06deadd4)  
  
  - This script doesn't support `Multi-Tool` or `Multi-Material` printing.
  - For a `Bambu Lab` 3D printer, you need to Avoid `Flow Calibration` and `First Layer Inspection` used at the beginning of the print.  
  - `Ironing` is not recommended with this script, as it can affect the desired results and increase printing time.  
  - `Adaptive Pressure Advance` is not recommended with this script.  
  - `Delta Printers` kinematic limits are not supported with the current version of Klipper Estimator.  
  - Reading or generating large G-Code files with this Script can takes up to 2 minutes, depending in your `CPU`.
  - Processing G-Code with `Arcs Moves` will take longer, because the Klipper Estimator script will cut them into small segments based on the parameter `"mm_per_arc_segment": 0.1`.
  - The generated G-Code is 10% to 30% larger than the original one due to Temp and Speed adjustment.
  - This script is currently only available for `Windows OS`. With `Delphi 12` and some changes to the source code, it can be compiled for other operating systems (I can help with this or do it later!).  
  
# Ideal Flow/Temperature Calibration
The visual calibration method (effective for PETG, PLA, etc.) involves selecting the desired appearance (closest to the original filament) over 3 to 5 prints:  

  1. For high flow rates (>3mm³/s), print a `Cylinder` in `Vase Mode` (You can use the maximum layer height and maximum line width), while limiting the maximum volumetric speed to the desired test flow rate. Start with the maximum recommended temperature, then manually and gradually reduce the temperature during printing. (This step should be done without the script)  
  2. For flow rates below 5 or 3 mm³/s, print small object like a 3DBenchy at 20% or 30% scale. (This step should be done with the script)  
  
### Note: 
- This method is not suitable for non-shiny filaments or those that do not change color. To determine the ideal values, other advanced solutions will be necessary, particularly for assessing layer adhesion, dimensional accuracy, or the final temperature of the extruded filament.
- This script allows to play with only three `Flow/Temperature` values, which means it will adjust them linearly.  
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a36e823-f3c5-4fe1-9453-c590bf6e5435)  
  
The ideal would be to obtain the final temperature of the extruded filament using a more accurate and automated solution that gives a curve closer to reality!  
This will also be useful with Filaments that cannot be visually calibrated.  
  
I challenge makers to find a precise, cost-effective, and user-friendly solution for the majority of 3D printers :rocket:  
  
# Observations and Tips
  - I recommend that you calibrate your PID values ​​for a temperature between 70% and 90% of the maximum temperature.  
  - A printer with higher accelerations and lower hotend heating/cooling time, will have a better result with this approach because it allows for better flow stabilization (Quality) and Higher Max/Average Flow (Speed).  
  - With a resonable Edeal Flow/Temperature calibration, the same good quality is achieved with the majority of filament brands without any changes in the script.    
  - With some prints, changing the `Max/Average Smoothing value` may affect the result and print time, you have to experiment yourself (I recommend values between 10 and 30).  
  - Aim for `Speed Optimization` as long as it doesn't affect the desired quality, usually the printing time will only vary by a few minutes.  
  - If your filament is very sensitive and you need to reduce the speed for overhangs or small features in between large features, aim for `Quality Optimization` to reduce flow variation.  
  - `Fuzzy Skin`, `Variable_Layer_Height` and `Scarf_Joint_Seam` can cause print delay due to frequent flow changes.  
  - The outer wall speed is greater than the inner wall speed due to a deferent line width. This script will adapt the speed to any line width and layer height, making it very effective for `Variable_Layer_Height` and `Precise_Z_Height`.

# Usage  
The script will popup once you Print or Export the G-Code from the Slicer, ask the user whether the script will be applied or not.   
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1589c73-8261-4171-89c9-ff0ca416f5fb)  
  
If yes, the first execution:  
  - You have to set the appropriate `Extruder/Printer` values.
  - Klipper Estimator script requires a file containing the maximum limits of the printer `(config .json)`.
    - For Klipper, you can get this file by entering the printer's IP address or by selecting a local file.
    - For other firmware, you'll need to edit the file manually and input the equivalent values.  
  Config.json file Example:  
    ```
    {
    "max_velocity": 400.0,
    "max_acceleration": 10000.0,
    "minimum_cruise_ratio": 0.5,
    "square_corner_velocity": 5.0,
    "instant_corner_velocity": 1.0,
    "mm_per_arc_segment": 0.1,
    "move_checkers": [
      {
        "axis_limiter": {
          "axis": [
            0.0,
            0.0,
            1.0
          ],
          "max_velocity": 5.0,
          "max_accel": 200.0
        }
      },
      {
        "extruder_limiter": {
          "max_velocity": 106.43243214765772,
          "max_accel": 2660.8108036914427
        }
      }
    ]
    }
    ```  
    Note that You have to set this file for each `Printer/Extruder` preset.  
  - After saving the `Extruder/Printer` preset, you need to select the `Filament Type`, then set the filament values (start with 1mm3/2) and save with a specific name. (for each Extruder)  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b6c98a9-0847-4118-a9d6-f37696be13a9)  
    
  ### Note that:
  - In subsequent uses, the script can recognize the `Extruder/Printer` and `Filament` used, if they are written with the same name as in the slicer (Copy and Paste).  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b467275-4bed-4927-adc6-0a6306d95de6)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0219a6d0-63d1-4b7e-b465-d45c74db0d49)
