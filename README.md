# G-Code-Flow-Temperature-Controller
A Post Processing Script for Slic3r based Slicers and Klipper 3D Printers.  
  
This 3D Printing Concept is Based on my personal approach and with a minimum of Delphi programming skills.  
Its operation consists of varying the temperature according to the average flow rate during printing time, and then limit the speed in the G-Code to the recommended flow rate for the temperature reached.  
  
This Script is free and open source, created to prove the effectiveness of automatic Speeds/Flow and Nozzle temperature change during 3D printing in order to get the best Quality/Speed Optimization and reduce 3D Printing complexity.  
  
This Script is not intended to be a definitive solution as I believe that integrating this concept in slicers will be more effective.  
  
I think this will be the future of 3D printing, i encourage you to test and develop it, with the hope that it will be integrated into the slicers.
